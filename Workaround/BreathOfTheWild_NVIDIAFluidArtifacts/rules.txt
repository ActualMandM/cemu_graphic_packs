# This pack fixes blocky artifacts found on fluids like lava and water.
# However, this pack does cause tile transition issues which don't appear to smooth over.
# If you experience these issues, it's recommended to enable this pack. Otherwise, don't.
# This bug (and graphic pack) only affects GPU's from the Maxwell or Pascal generation (roughly everything above GTX 700).

# This graphic pack is made as an easy to install alternative to this fix by Flocker:
# https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/6qwmon/got_blocky_artifacts_in_lava_water_and_other/ 
# The difference is that this fix reduces it, while it doesn't have the tile transition issue.
# It also requires an external program and might reset itself on a driver installation (unlikely).
