name = Fixes Reshade depth buffer compatibility
path = "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Mods/Reshade compatibility"
description = DON'T ENABLE THIS IF YOU'RE NOT USING RESHADE since it creates flickering mountains and geometry. Does remove depth buffer flickering with certain camera angles which breaks some reshade effects like e.g. MXAO and ray tracing.
